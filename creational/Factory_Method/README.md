### Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need for code to depend on specific classes by instead relying on a common interface.

#### Key Features:
1. **Interface-Based Creation**: Establishes a method within an interface to create an object.
2. **Subclass Responsibility**: Allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
3. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates the object creation process and details.

#### Benefits:
- **Flexibility**: Provides a way to defer object instantiation to subclasses, making the code more flexible and extensible.
- **Loose Coupling**: Eliminates the dependency on concrete variants, focusing instead on the interface level.
- **Reusability**: Encourages code reuse by decoupling code that uses objects from the actual object classes.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity**: Can introduce unnecessary complexity if an architecture does not actually benefit from such decoupling.
- **Subclassing Overhead**: Requires subclassing, which may increase the number of classes in your system.
- **Interface Expansion**: Overuse can lead to proliferations of interfaces and result in difficulty managing code.
