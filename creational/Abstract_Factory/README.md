### Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Through abstractions, it allows the client code to work with any set of objects (from different families) without being tightly coupled to specific classes.

#### Key Features:
1. **Family Creation**: Capable of creating a group or family of related objects.
2. **Abstraction**: Hides the detailed implementation of objects from the client.
3. **Decoupling**: Decouples client code from concrete classes.

#### Benefits:
- **Consistency**: Ensures that families of related objects are used together consistently.
- **Scalability**: Makes it easier to introduce new sets of products (families) without breaking existing code.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for flexibility in substituting families of products.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity**: Can introduce complexity due to the additional abstraction layers and interfaces.
- **Rigid Framework**: Adding variations that donâ€™t fit existing families can become cumbersome.
- **Configuration**: Choosing the right factory at runtime requires additional configuration or decision logic.

#### Golang Implementation:

In Go, the Abstract Factory pattern can be implemented using interfaces to define families of products while implementing concrete factories to create these products.

Let's imagine a world of widgets where we have two families: MacOS and Windows. Each family has a button and a checkbox.
