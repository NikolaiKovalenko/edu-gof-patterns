### Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct a complex object step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is useful when the object construction process involves many steps or configurations.

#### Key Features:
1. **Step-by-Step Construction**: Enables construction of a complex object step by step.
2. **Different Representations**: Supports creation of different representations of the same object.
3. **Director Role**: Optionally uses a "Director" class to control the building process.

#### Benefits:
- **Controlled Construction**: Provides better control over the construction process of complex objects.
- **Code Readability**: Increases readability by clearly segregating object configuration and construction.
- **Reuse**: Makes it easy to produce different representations of an object using the same building process.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity**: Can introduce complexity if the object being constructed is not inherently complex.
- **Overhead**: May introduce unnecessary overhead if the number of steps is limited or straightforward.

The Builder pattern is useful where the construction of an object is complex, allowing for a clean separation and management of the objectâ€™s creation logic. It helps in situations where you want to be able to create different representations of a product with similar processes.
