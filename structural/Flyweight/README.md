### Flyweight Pattern

The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that aims to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. It's particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that might have identical or similar data.

#### Key Features:
- **Shared State (Intrinsic state)**: Data that is shared among objects. It is stored in the flyweight, avoiding repetition.
- **Non-Shared State (Extrinsic state)**: Data that is unique for each object instance, managed by the client.

#### Benefits:
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Significantly lowers memory footprint when working with large numbers of objects.
- **Performance**: Improves performance by reducing the need to instantiate many objects.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity**: Can introduce additional complexity in terms of state management, distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic data.
- **Inflexibility**: Requires careful planning to ensure that the objects can actually share common data effectively.

The Flyweight pattern is especially beneficial in scenarios where many identical objects are required, such as in rendering graphical elements, managing large datasets, or working with network protocols where data can be shared among requests. This pattern reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of objects.
