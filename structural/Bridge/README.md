### Bridge Pattern

The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that separates the abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently. It is particularly useful when both the abstractions and their implementations may vary or be extended through inheritance.

#### Key Features:
- **Decoupling**: Decouples abstraction from implementation so that they can evolve independently.
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Utilizes composition rather than inheritance, allowing for more flexible and dynamic implementation structures.
- **Incremental Development**: Facilitates the incremental and independent development of the abstraction and implementation.

#### Benefits:
- **Scalability**: Supports independent scalability of interfaces and implementations.
- **Flexibility**: Offers flexibility in changing how the abstraction and implementation interact at runtime.
- **Simplifies Code**: Simplifies maintenance and reduces complexity by segregating the code into layers with clear responsibilities.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Increased Complexity**: Can introduce additional complexity due to more classes and interfaces.
- **Over-engineering**: May lead to unnecessary complexity if not properly justified by the need for independent variation.

The Bridge pattern is particularly beneficial when your system architecture requires multiple abstraction-implementation mappings, helping maintain clean boundaries and modular design practices.
