### Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It involves creating an adapter that translates the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.

#### Key Features:
- **Interface Compatibility**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.
- **Class and Object Adapter**:
    - **Class Adapter**: Uses multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another.
    - **Object Adapter**: Uses composition to wrap an object and provide a different interface.

#### Benefits:
- **Reusability**: Allows the reuse of existing classes irrespective of incompatible interfaces.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Promotes better separation of concerns by separating the interface conversion logic into a distinct adapter class.
- **Flexibility**: Facilitates the interoperability of classes with incompatible interfaces, enabling flexibility in how components are used together.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity**: Can introduce additional complexity if many adapters are needed.
- **Runtime Overhead**: May introduce a performance overhead due to the additional level of indirection.

Suppose you have a service that delivers data in a format different than what your application expects. You can use an adapter to bridge this gap.

This pattern is best used when you want to integrate your code with a library or class that doesnâ€™t have a matching interface, allowing you to easily plug different pieces together without modifying their source code.
