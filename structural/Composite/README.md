### Composite Pattern

The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern aimed at treating individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It helps you to represent part-whole hierarchies as tree structures, enabling clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects in the same way.

#### Key Features:
- **Uniformity**: Allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Recursive Composition**: Represents part-whole hierarchies using tree structures.
- **Component Interface**: Establishes a common interface for all individual and composite objects.

#### Benefits:
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies client code since it can treat leaf and composite nodes the same.
- **Flexibility**: Provides a flexible way to create complex structures from simple components.
- **Scalability**: Easily adds new component types and composite types.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity**: Can make the design overly general, making it more complex than needed for simple structures.
- **Inefficiency**: Overhead of managing the tree structures can become significant, particularly if deep hierarchies are involved.

The Composite pattern is useful in scenarios such as GUI frameworks and file systems, where operations need to be performed uniformly across both composite and individual nodes.
