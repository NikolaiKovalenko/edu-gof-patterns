### Proxy Pattern

The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It acts as an intermediary between a client and the object it accesses, adding an additional layer of functionality.

#### Key Features:
- **Access Control**: Can manage access to the real object.
- **Lazy Initialization**: Can delay the creation and initialization of expensive objects until absolutely necessary.
- **Protection**: Can enforce access rights on the real object.

#### Benefits:
- **Efficiency**: Can improve efficiency by controlling access and implementing lazy initialization.
- **Control**: Offers a way to extend the functionality of the real object transparently.
- **Security**: Can provide secure access, logging, or caching.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity**: Adds additional complexity and can introduce a level of indirection.
- **Performance Overhead**: The extra processing required by the proxy can introduce performance costs, especially if the proxy does not significantly reduce the use of resources.

#### Types of Proxies:
- **Virtual Proxy**: Controls access to resource-intensive objects.
- **Remote Proxy**: Manages interaction with objects in different address spaces.
- **Protection Proxy**: Controls access rights to certain operations.
- **Smart Proxy**: Provides additional functionality like caching.

The Proxy pattern is particularly useful when implementing lazy loading, access control, and logging, and is often used in situations requiring secure access to resources, such as databases, files, and external resources.
