### Decorator Pattern

The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

#### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Enables adding responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Flexible Extension**: Provides a flexible way of enhancing the behavior of individual objects without altering the structure.
- **Wrapper Approach**: Involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.

#### Benefits:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Divides functionality between classes with unique concerns.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New functionality can be added without altering existing code.
- **Flexible Combinations**: Enables the creation of different chains of decorators for unique behaviors.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity**: Can add complexity to the system due to the numerous small objects that look alike.
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Hard to troubleshoot when many layers of wrappers are used.

The Decorator pattern is ideal for situations where multiple combinations of behaviors are needed, such as I/O streams, window systems, or in any situation where you may need to add multiple attributes dynamically to an object. It provides a more modular approach compared to using subclasses, allowing combinations of responsibilities to be assembled at runtime.
