### Command Pattern

The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation allows you to parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

#### Key Features:
- **Encapsulation of Requests**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization and queuing.
- **Decoupling**: Decouples the sender of a request from its receiver.
- **Supports Undo/Redo**: Commands can be easily logged and executed later, supporting undo/redo operations.

#### Benefits:
- **Extensibility**: New commands can be added without changing existing code.
- **Reusability**: Commands can be reused in different contexts.
- **Flexibility**: Allows executing operations later and supports complex command sequences.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity**: Can introduce additional complexity if the application already handles simple requests cleanly.
- **Learning Overhead**: May require understanding how commands are structured and scheduled.

The Command pattern shines in applications where several contextual operations need to be executed, tracked, and potentially undone, such as text editors, UI elements (buttons, menus), and task scheduling systems. It provides a clear and extensible structure to manage complex sequences of operations.
