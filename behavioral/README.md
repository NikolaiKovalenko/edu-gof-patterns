Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help in defining how objects interact and communicate with each other, allowing complex behavioral flows to be managed more effectively. Here’s a detailed overview of each of the GoF behavioral patterns:

### 1. [Chain of Responsibility Pattern](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-gof-patterns/tree/main/behavioral/Chain_Of_Responsibility)
- **Purpose**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler can either handle the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.
- **Key Features**: Promotes loose coupling between sender and receiver. Useful for scenarios where multiple objects can handle a request but the exact handler isn't known beforehand.

### 2. [Command Pattern](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-gof-patterns/tree/main/behavioral/Command)
- **Purpose**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Key Features**: Decouples the sender of a request from its receiver by encapsulating this information in a command. Useful in undo/redo mechanisms.

### 3. [Interpreter Pattern](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-gof-patterns/tree/main/behavioral/Interpreter)
- **Purpose**: Given a language, defines a representation for its grammar and an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
- **Key Features**: Typically used in the context of compilers or implementing domain-specific languages.

### 4. [Iterator Pattern](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-gof-patterns/tree/main/behavioral/Iterator)
- **Purpose**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Key Features**: Allows traversal of collections in a uniform manner.

### 5. [Mediator Pattern](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-gof-patterns/tree/main/behavioral/Mediator)
- **Purpose**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
- **Key Features**: Centralizes complex communications and control logic between related objects, reducing chaotic dependencies.

### 6. [Memento Pattern](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-gof-patterns/tree/main/behavioral/Memento)
- **Purpose**: Without violating encapsulation, captures and externalizes an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
- **Key Features**: Useful for implementing undo mechanisms or supporting state rollback.

### 7. [Observer Pattern](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-gof-patterns/tree/main/behavioral/Observer)
- **Purpose**: Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Key Features**: Facilitates event-driven designs with dynamic behavior.

### 8. [State Pattern](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-gof-patterns/tree/main/behavioral/State)
- **Purpose**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
- **Key Features**: Helps in object behavioral changes without condition statements.

### 9. [Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-gof-patterns/tree/main/behavioral/Strategy)
- **Purpose**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.
- **Key Features**: Promotes the use of composition over inheritance for behavioral changes.

### 10. [Template Method Pattern](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-gof-patterns/tree/main/behavioral/Template_Method)
- **Purpose**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Key Features**: Allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.

### 11. [Visitor Pattern](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-gof-patterns/tree/main/behavioral/Visitor)
- **Purpose**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
- **Key Features**: Useful for performing various operations on complex object structures without modifying the structures themselves.

Each of these patterns addresses specific issues regarding object collaboration and responsibility distribution in software. They offer solutions to common problems, helping in the creation of flexible, maintainable, and scalable systems. Choosing the right pattern depends on the specific needs and constraints of your project.
