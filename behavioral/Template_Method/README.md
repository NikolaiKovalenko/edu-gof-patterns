### Template Method Pattern

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure, promoting code reuse while allowing flexibility to apply specific behaviors.

#### Key Features:
- **Algorithm Structure**: The base class defines the overall structure of an algorithm, outlining what steps should occur and in what order.
- **Deferring Steps**: Specific steps of the algorithm are implemented by subclasses.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent processing steps across subclasses while allowing customization of certain behaviors.

#### Benefits:
- **Code Reuse**: Encourages reuse of common code across several subclasses by incorporating a shared template in the superclass.
- **Flexibility**: Subclasses can implement variable parts of an algorithm, offering flexibility.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Centralizes the algorithm's invariants in one place, easing updates and maintenance.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Inheritance Dependency**: Relies on subclassing, which means all modifications must be done in the subclass, potentially leading to rigid class hierarchies.
- **Limited by Inheritance**: If used improperly, it can hinder flexibility due to a strong dependency on the parent class structure.

### Usage:
The Template Method pattern is ideal for situations where you have invariant steps in an algorithm, but you need flexibility for parts of the process. Itâ€™s commonly used to implement frameworks, libraries, and shared functionality in a consistent manner while allowing customization through subclass extensions.
