### Mediator Pattern

The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that reduces coupling between components (often referred to as "colleagues") by having them communicate indirectly through a special object called a mediator. Instead of components communicating directly with each other, they pass their communications through the mediator, which takes care of orchestrating the interactions.

#### Key Features:
- **Centralized Control**: The mediator handles the coordination between components, promoting loose coupling.
- **Encapsulation of Comms**: Encapsulates how objects interact, which can vary independently from the objects themselves.
- **Simplified Object Protocols**: Objects do not need to reference each other directly, reducing dependencies.

#### Benefits:
- **Loose Coupling**: Reduces the number of direct connections between components, simplifying maintenance.
- **Manageability**: Simplifies system management by centralizing control logic in the mediator.
- **Flexibility**: Changes to communication between components require changes only in the mediator.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Mediator Complexity**: If the mediator grows too complex, it may become a "god object" that ends up managing too much.
- **Single Point of Control**: The mediator becomes a central point where everything converges, which might affect performance or simplicity if not managed properly.

This implementation demonstrates how the Mediator pattern can be used to manage complex communication flows in a decoupled manner. It's useful in scenarios like chat applications, form control interactions, and workflow automation where components interact frequently.
