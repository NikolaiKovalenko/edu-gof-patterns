### Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where changes in one object should be reflected in others without causing tight coupling.

### Key Features:
- **Subject and Observers**: Consists of a subject that maintains a list of dependents (observers) and notifies them of any state changes.
- **Loose Coupling**: Observers are loosely coupled to the subject and can be added or removed independently.
- **Automatic Notification**: When the subject changes, all observers are automatically notified and updated.

### Benefits:
- **Decoupling**: Subjects and observers are decoupled, allowing for independent modification and reuse.
- **Dynamic Relationships**: Observers can be added, removed, or changed dynamically at runtime.
- **Scalability**: Supports broadcast communication, where one subject notifies multiple observers.

### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity in Communication**: Can lead to undesired notifications if not managed properly.
- **Performance**: If too many observers exist, updating them all might lead to performance bottlenecks.
- **Order of Notification**: The order of notification might cause issues if some observers depend on others.

The Observer pattern is commonly used in event handling systems, GUI frameworks, and real-time data feeds. By separating the logic of notification from the business logic, it allows for flexible and dynamic system designs.
