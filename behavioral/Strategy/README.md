### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm’s behavior at runtime by defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

#### Key Features:
- **Encapsulation of Algorithms**: Each algorithm is encapsulated in its own class.
- **Interchangeability**: Algorithms can be swapped in and out without modifying the client code.
- **Runtime Flexibility**: Clients can choose and change strategies at runtime as needed.

#### Benefits:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each strategy’s behavior is separated into its own class, making it easier to maintain and extend.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New strategies can be introduced without changing the existing context.
- **Improved Code Organization**: Eliminates conditional statements, facilitating cleaner code.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Overhead**: If many strategies are required, it can result in increased complexity with additional classes.
- **Client Awareness**: The client must be aware of the different strategies available to select the appropriate one.

The Strategy pattern is advantageous in situations where you need different variants of an algorithm, like sorting functions, validation strategies, or payment methods, allowing dynamic changes to the algorithm without altering client-side code.
