### Iterator Pattern

The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It is particularly useful for traversing collections of objects in a uniform manner.

#### Key Features:
- **Uniform Access**: Provides a standard way to iterate over a collection without knowing its internal structure.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Decouples the iteration logic from the collection itself.
- **Supports Multiple Iterators**: Allows multiple iterator objects to traverse the same collection independently.

#### Benefits:
- **Simplifies Collection Traversal**: Provides a straightforward way to navigate through complex data structures.
- **Improved Flexibility**: Allows switching the sequence or manner of traversal without changing the collection.
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Iteration logic can be reused across different collections.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Overhead**: Creating an additional iterator object can introduce overhead, especially for large collections.
- **Complexity**: Implementing a custom iterator can be complex for certain data structures, especially if specific traversal logic is needed.
- **Concurrency**: Iterators can complicate concurrency, as they may need to lock data structures or account for concurrent modifications.

### Use Case:
The Iterator pattern is widely used in software development where collection traversal is needed. It provides a uniform interface for different types of collections and supports the separation of iteration logic from the collection itself. This pattern is especially beneficial in libraries and APIs that offer multiple ways to traverse data, enhancing flexibility and reusability.
