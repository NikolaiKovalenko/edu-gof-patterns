### Visitor Pattern

The Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. By moving the operations to a visitor class, the pattern allows you to add new operations without modifying the existing object structure. This is especially useful when working with composite structures.

#### Key Features:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Decouples algorithm implementation from the object structure, allowing more flexibility in both areas.
- **Extensibility**: New operations can be added without modifying the classes of the elements on which it operates.
- **Double Dispatch**: The actual method called depends on the runtime types of both the visitor and the element, allowing for dynamic behavior.

#### Benefits:
- **Easy Addition of Operations**: Adding new operations is straightforward as it involves adding new visitor classes rather than modifying existing object structures.
- **Improves Maintainability**: By separating the operations from the data structures, it makes the overall code easier to maintain.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Tight Coupling**: The visitor class must know the concrete classes in the object structure, leading to tight coupling between the visitor and the object classes.
- **Ease of Addition**: While adding operations is easy, adding new elements to the structure necessitates modifying the visitor interface, which can become cumbersome.
- **Complexity**: Increases the complexity of the system if overused, especially if many visitor classes are created.
