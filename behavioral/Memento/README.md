### Memento Pattern

The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object's state to be captured and stored so that it can be restored later without exposing the details of its implementation. It's commonly used to implement undo/redo functionality in applications.

#### Key Features:
- **State Preservation**: Allows an object's full internal state to be saved and restored later.
- **Encapsulation**: Ensures that the state is restored without breaking encapsulation, as the memento stores the state privately.
- **Generics**: The use of mementos can be generalized across different objects and states, making it versatile for various applications.

#### Benefits:
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Facilitates undo and redo by storing previous states that can be restored.
- **Encapsulation Maintenance**: Keeps the internal state of the object encapsulated, as only the originator is allowed to create and maintain the memento.
- **History Management**: Provides a way to manage the history of states over time.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Memory Consumption**: If the states are large or numerous, storing a lot of mementos can consume significant memory.
- **Performance Overhead**: Frequent creation and management of mementos can introduce performance overhead.
- **Complexity**: Managing a large set of mementos might lead to increased complexity in handling the lifecycle and retrieval of these objects.

### Golang Implementation

Here's a detailed example of the Memento pattern applied to a simple text editor application:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Memento stores the state of the Editor
type Memento struct {
	state string
}

// Editor is the originator, which can create and restore mementos
type Editor struct {
	content string
}

func (e *Editor) Write(text string) {
	e.content += text
}

func (e *Editor) Save() *Memento {
	return &Memento{state: e.content}
}

func (e *Editor) Restore(m *Memento) {
	e.content = m.state
}

func (e *Editor) Content() string {
	return e.content
}

// Caretaker manages the memento objects
type Caretaker struct {
	history []*Memento
}

func (c *Caretaker) AddMemento(m *Memento) {
	c.history = append(c.history, m)
}

func (c *Caretaker) GetMemento(index int) *Memento {
	if index >= 0 && index < len(c.history) {
		return c.history[index]
	}
	return nil
}

func main() {
	editor := &Editor{}
	caretaker := &Caretaker{}

	// Initial writing
	editor.Write("First line.\n")
	caretaker.AddMemento(editor.Save())

	// Additional writing
	editor.Write("Second line.\n")
	caretaker.AddMemento(editor.Save())

	// Writing further
	editor.Write("Third line.\n")
	fmt.Println("Current Content:\n", editor.Content())

	// Undoing operations
	editor.Restore(caretaker.GetMemento(1))
	fmt.Println("\nAfter Undo 1:\n", editor.Content())

	editor.Restore(caretaker.GetMemento(0))
	fmt.Println("\nAfter Undo 2:\n", editor.Content())
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Memento Struct**: Holds the state of the `Editor` at a particular instant. It is created and used by the editor to store and retrieve its state.
- **Originator (Editor)**: The object that creates a memento containing its current state. It can also restore its state from the memento.
- **Caretaker**: Manages the collection of `Memento` objects, adding new mementos to history and providing them for state restoration when needed.
- **Client Code**: Simulates a user writing to the `Editor`, saving states, and restoring earlier states to implement undo functionality.

Through this implementation, the Memento pattern effectively encapsulates state handling and retrieval, allowing the `Editor` to manage its versions securely and flexibly. This kind of design is beneficial in applications that require managing complex states over multiple interactions.
