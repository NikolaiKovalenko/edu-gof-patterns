### Memento Pattern

The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object's state to be captured and stored so that it can be restored later without exposing the details of its implementation. It's commonly used to implement undo/redo functionality in applications.

#### Key Features:
- **State Preservation**: Allows an object's full internal state to be saved and restored later.
- **Encapsulation**: Ensures that the state is restored without breaking encapsulation, as the memento stores the state privately.
- **Generics**: The use of mementos can be generalized across different objects and states, making it versatile for various applications.

#### Benefits:
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Facilitates undo and redo by storing previous states that can be restored.
- **Encapsulation Maintenance**: Keeps the internal state of the object encapsulated, as only the originator is allowed to create and maintain the memento.
- **History Management**: Provides a way to manage the history of states over time.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Memory Consumption**: If the states are large or numerous, storing a lot of mementos can consume significant memory.
- **Performance Overhead**: Frequent creation and management of mementos can introduce performance overhead.
- **Complexity**: Managing a large set of mementos might lead to increased complexity in handling the lifecycle and retrieval of these objects.
