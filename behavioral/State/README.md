### State Pattern

The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful when an object’s behavior is determined by its state, and it needs to switch its behavior to something else when the state changes.

#### Key Features:
- **State-Specific Behavior**: Encapsulates state-specific behavior and transitions inside separate state objects.
- **Context**: Maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.
- **Flexibility**: Changes in state lead to changes in behavior without modifying the object itself.

#### Benefits:
- **Improved Organization**: Organizes code related to specific states within dedicated classes.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New states can be added without changing existing code.
- **Simplified Code**: Reduces complex conditionals when state-based behavior is implemented using separate classes.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity**: Can increase the number of classes and objects in the application.
- **Overhead**: Managing states might introduce overhead, especially if the states are numerous.

The State pattern is useful when an object’s behavior needs to change dynamically based on its state, such as in user interfaces (buttons enabling/disabling), process workflows, and finite state machines. It encourages cleaner, more modular designs by clearly separating state-specific logic.
